    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Love those ooey-gooey cinnamon buns you find at the shopping mall? 
            These sweet, tender (some would say squishy) cinnamon buns, 
            crowned with a thick dollop of rich cream cheese icing, make a 
            trip to the mall (or airport) unnecessary.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup (227g) lukewarm milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons (74g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>4 1/2 cups (539g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>1 3/4 teaspoons (11g) salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (99g) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast, active dry yeast, or one 1/4-ounce packet of Platinum Yeast from Red Star</li>
            </ul>    
        <h3>Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>5 tablespoons (74g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup (213g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons (21g) cinnamon</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Icing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 ounces (85g) cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (170g) confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix together and knead all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth, soft dough.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to grease all sides, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise until it's nearly doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours depending on the warmth of your kitchen.</li>
            <li>To fill and shape the buns: Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. Roll the dough into a 16" x 21" rectangle.</li>
            <li>Spread the dough with the 1/3 cup butter. Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle it evenly over the dough.</li>
            <li>Starting with a short end, roll the dough into a log and cut it into 12 slices.</li>
            <li>Place the buns in a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan. Cover the pan and let the buns rise until they're nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the buns are rising, preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Uncover the buns, and bake them until they're golden brown, about 15 minutes. While the buns are baking, make the icing.</li>
            <li>To make the icing: In a small bowl, beat together the cream cheese, butter, sugar, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Remove the buns from the oven. Spread the icing on the buns while they're warm.</li>
            <li>Serve buns warm, or at room temperature. Wrap in plastic and store at room temperature for a day or so; freeze for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
